## Minimalist weather app
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that shows the current weather in any given location. It uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the current weather and the [Geoapify API](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/) to get the location and the autocomplete suggestions.
Here's a preview:
